## Week 1
### What have I learnt this week?
The introductory lecture taught me about the basics of human complex systems as well as an overview of the subject. It also taught me the key attributes of a system and what
makes a system complex or complicated. There was also the concept of emergence which occurs when a component interacts with the larger system. There was also technical systems
and social systems, and the combined result; socio-technical systems.

### This week I learned about:
 - What is a system?
 - Boundaries, characteristics and key attributes of systems
 - What makes a system complex or complicated?
 - Complex systems showing self-organisation and emergence
 - Complex adaptive systems and their characteristics (distributed control, far from equilibrium...)
 - System categories

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I now have a basic knowledge of complex systems and will be ready for whatever this subject throws at me as a result. I was previously unaware that there
were so many components to a system and didn't even know what a complex (unpredictable)/complicated (more predictable and clear) system was. Basically, I learnt what I was
going to study for the next few months.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process during the lecture, I understood the basics behind systems and the fact that they can be complex, complicated, technical, social and
so on. I gained insight into the aspects of each of these systems.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Most of the content, I found that I could understand most of the systems and the boundaries part well.  
*Weaknesses*: Complex adaptive systems, I found some of the points (particularly far from equilibrium) difficult to understand.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I read through the lecture notes afterwards so I could soak it all in and understand it better. I also looked up complex adaptive systems online which helped me understand it
further. I made sure that I understood it and the far-from-equilibrium point as it is an important topic in this subject.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Possibly get a few more pictures on my notes to help me understand the topics better. Read over the lecture notes carefully and make sure I can comprehend everything.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory of complex systems was the most useful to me because it is the basis of this subject and essential into understanding potential outcomes in an environment. In the
future, I will be able to identify a complex system using the content I learnt in this lecture. This includes identifying structure, behaviour, a set of rules, unpredictability
and so on.


## Week 2
### What have I learnt this week?
I learnt how models can help us understand data that could not previously be understood, and the various other reasons behind using models. Other important parts of this
week's learning include bias and how it affects people's models, how to write a model and REDCAPE.

### This week I learned about:
 - Why we use models
 - How bias affects our perception of the world around us and models as a result
 - How to write a model
 - How models help us understand data, strategise and design things
 - Embodiment approach (realism), analogy approach (abstract), alternate reality approach (purposely doesn't capture reality)
 - REDCAPE
 - A bit about Wisdom of the Crowd

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I have a deeper knowledge of the need for models to help people understand the world arround us, and the bias that affects the creation of models.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process during the lecture, I understood the 7 uses of models (REDCAPE) which explains why people use models. I found that this topic gave me
an accurate understanding of models and the reasons they are created in the first place.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Different approaches to models, REDCAPE, why models are used and bias.  
*Weaknesses*: Wisdom of the crowd (more info next lecture), how models help us strategise and design.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Possibly the maths in the wisdom of the crowd section, but apparently I don't need to understand all that. I felt that a lot of content repeated itself so I lost focus quickly.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Focus with no distractions, do the reflection the same day as the class (rather than a week later) so I remember it clearly. That way I will be able to understand the content
to the best of my ability.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
In reflecting upon REDCAPE, it was useful to observe all the different reasons for implementing a model. I learnt there are multiple reasons to implement a model rather than
for the sole use of explaining a difficult concept.


## Week 3
### What have I learnt this week?
I learnt how models are influenced by human behaviour and how there are multiple ways of modelling people (rational/behavioural/rule-based).

### This week I learned about:
 - The multiple models for people (rational/behavioural/rule-based)
 - Rule-based models
 - Decision making
 - Different types of probability (classical, frequency, subjective)
 - Signalling (discrete and continuous)
 - A bit on the Shapley value
 - Perspectives, heuristics and how it alters the model in our head.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I have a deeper knowledge of the way to model people, and the perspectives, heuristics and psychological effects that alter our perception of models.
I enjoyed learning about the nature of humans and the fact that this means that they are difficult to model.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process during the lecture, I understood how models are heavily influenced by a person's opinion of the world and whether they act upon
rational thinking, behavioural or a set of rules. Some signals are costly and others are not but it depends on whether the person is emotionally strong or weak.
Costliness carries meaning.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Multiple models of people, fixed and adaptive rule-based models, normative and positive decision making, discrete signals vs continous signals, perspective.  
*Weaknesses*: Shapley value (got the concept, not the maths)

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Shapley value maths, I handled the overall concept however not the maths. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Focus on the math and revise the material after the lecture.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
In reflecting upon this lecture, it was useful to observe all the different factors that alter a person's perspective which is why it is so difficult to model people.
Discrete signalling; pooling, separating and partial-pooling vs continuous signalling where signals vary in magnitude.


## Week 4
### What have I learnt this week?
I learnt how system dynamics models analyse dynamic systems with feedback and interdependencies. I also learnt about various different models.

### This week I learned about:
 - System Dynamics
 - Casual Loop Diagrams 
 - Interpreting behaviour (structure and behaviour)
 - Network models and logic
 - Informal mental models
 - Agent based models
 - Compartment models
 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I have a deeper knowledge of more ways to model - agent based, the details on informal models, compartment models and network models. I also understand how
agent based models simulate the world in a 1:1 ratio.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process during the lecture, I understood system dynamics and how the structure of a model can be inferred by the behaviour of an individual.
System dynamics can also represent stocks, flows, sources and sinks. ABM helped me gain insight into 1:1 models which are common.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Network models (done before), all the other models, system dynamics.  
*Weaknesses*: Some of the casual loop diagrams; e.g. reinforcing and balancing loop interactions.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I found the information easy to understand on the CLDs but the pictures confused me. I just resorted to looking at the info.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Do this reflection file sooner, maybe the night of the lecture or day after.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
In reflecting upon this lecture, it was useful to understand System Dynamics and how the structure of a model can be inferred from one's behaviour which I found interesting.
I also learnt about how ABMs are used in daily life.


## Week 5
### What have I learnt this week?
I learnt about the aggregation of decisions and behaviour through the use of statistics.

### This week I learned about:
 - Aggregation of data
 - Random variables
 - Went over stuff learnt in statistics like distributions and CLT
 - Long-tailed distributions 
 - Zipf's Law and Power Laws
 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I have a deeper understanding of statistics and its relation to models. I also learnt that aggregating data can be useful. There was also the TED talk, where
contributing to a city is a better choice than to contribute to a specific corporation.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process, I understand the various different distributions used to model continuous or discrete variables. I also found the TED talk with 
Geoffrey West particularly interesting - his analogy of biology and how it relates to social constructs and the economy in particular. There was also the part where cities
will have a constant cycle of innovation whereas corporations have the highest innovation at the beginning but eventually wither away as shown by Power Laws.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Statistics components (done before), probability, random variables.  
*Weaknesses*: Applications of long-tailed distributions to the real world and effects.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Zipf's Law was challenging but I carefully read through the lecture notes and understood it with the help of an example.  However, I understood most of the content due to 
having previous knowledge in statistics and mathematics. I had encountered many of the normal distributions in statistics, along with the Empirical rule which states that 
99.7% of data lies within 3 standard deviations, 95% lies within 2 sds, and 68% lies within 1 sd of the mean in a normal probability distribution. I had encountered log curves
in Maths subjects and could understand how it relates to corporations and cities as described in the TED talk.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Search for applications of these models in a business environment.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
In reflecting upon this lecture, it was useful to understand how aggregating data can help us in daily life and enhance our ability to understand topics. However, the TED talk
was the most interesting to me because of Geoff's theory that cities live forever. This is due to a constant cycle of design and innovation as a result of an 
ever-increasing population.
