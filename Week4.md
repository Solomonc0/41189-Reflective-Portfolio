# My Reflective Portfolio (13536331)
## Week 4
### What have I learnt this week?
I learnt how system dynamics models analyse dynamic systems with feedback and interdependencies. I also learnt about various different models.

### This week I learned about:
 - System Dynamics
 - Casual Loop Diagrams 
 - Interpreting behaviour (structure and behaviour)
 - Network models and logic
 - Informal mental models
 - Agent based models
 - Compartment models
 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I have a deeper knowledge of more ways to model - agent based, the details on informal models, compartment models and network models. I also understand how
agent based models simulate the world in a 1:1 ratio.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process during the lecture, I understood system dynamics and how the structure of a model can be inferred by the behaviour of an individual.
System dynamics can also represent stocks, flows, sources and sinks. ABM helped me gain insight into 1:1 models which are common.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Network models (done before), all the other models, system dynamics.  
*Weaknesses*: Some of the casual loop diagrams; e.g. reinforcing and balancing loop interactions.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I found the information easy to understand on the CLDs but the pictures confused me. I just resorted to looking at the info.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Do this reflection file sooner, maybe the night of the lecture or day after.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
In reflecting upon this lecture, it was useful to understand System Dynamics and how the structure of a model can be inferred from one's behaviour which I found interesting.
I also learnt about how ABMs are used in daily life.
