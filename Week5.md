# My Reflective Portfolio (13536331)
## Week 5
### What have I learnt this week?
I learnt about the aggregation of decisions and behaviour through the use of statistics.

### This week I learned about:
 - Aggregation of data
 - Random variables
 - Went over stuff learnt in statistics like distributions and CLT
 - Long-tailed distributions 
 - Zipf's Law and Power Laws
 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I have a deeper understanding of statistics and its relation to models. I also learnt that aggregating data can be useful.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process, I understand the various different distributions used to model continuous or discrete variables.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Statistics components (done before), probability, random variables.  
*Weaknesses*: Applications of long-tailed distributions to the real world and effects.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Zipf's Law was challenging but I carefully read through the lecture notes and understood it with the help of an example.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Search for applications of these models in a business environment.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
In reflecting upon this lecture, it was useful to understand how aggregating data can help us in daily life and enhance our ability to understand topics. Also, probability
is a big role in many models.
