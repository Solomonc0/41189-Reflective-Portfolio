# My Reflective Portfolio (13536331)
## Week 2
### What have I learnt this week?
I learnt how models can help us understand data that could not previously be understood, and the various other reasons behind using models. Other important parts of this
week's learning include bias and how it affects people's models, how to write a model and REDCAPE.

### This week I learned about:
 - Why we use models
 - How bias affects our perception of the world around us and models as a result
 - How to write a model
 - How models help us understand data, strategise and design things
 - Embodiment approach (realism), analogy approach (abstract), alternate reality approach (purposely doesn't capture reality)
 - REDCAPE
 - A bit about Wisdom of the Crowd

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I have a deeper knowledge of the need for models to help people understand the world arround us, and the bias that affects the creation of models.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process during the lecture, I understood the 7 uses of models (REDCAPE) which explains why people use models. I found that this topic gave me
an accurate understanding of models and the reasons they are created in the first place.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Different approaches to models, REDCAPE, why models are used and bias
*Weaknesses*: Wisdom of the crowd (more info next lecture), how models help us strategise and design

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Possibly the maths in the wisdom of the crowd section, but apparently I don't need to understand all that. I felt that a lot of content repeated itself so I lost focus quickly.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Focus with no distractions, do the reflection the same day as the class (rather than a week later) so I remember it clearly. That way I will be able to understand the content
to the best of my ability.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
In refleccting upon REDCAPE, it was useful to observe all the different reasons for implementing a model. I learnt there are multiple reasons to implement a model rather than
for the sole use of explaining a difficult concept.
