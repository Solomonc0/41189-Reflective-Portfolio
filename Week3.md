# My Reflective Portfolio (13536331)
## Week 3
### What have I learnt this week?
I learnt how models are influenced by human behaviour and how there are multiple ways of modelling people (rational/behavioural/rule-based).

### This week I learned about:
 - The multiple models for people (rational/behavioural/rule-based)
 - Rule-based models
 - Decision making
 - Different types of probability (classical, frequency, subjective)
 - Signalling (discrete and continuous)
 - A bit on the Shapley value
 - Perspectives, heuristics and how it alters the model in our head.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I have a deeper knowledge of the way to model people, and the perspectives, heuristics and psychological effects that alter our perception of models.
I enjoyed learning about the nature of humans and the fact that this means that they are difficult to model.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process during the lecture, I understood how models are heavily influenced by a person's opinion of the world and whether they act upon
rational thinking, behavioural or a set of rules. Some signals are costly and others are not but it depends on whether the person is emotionally strong or weak.
Costliness carries meaning.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Multiple models of people, fixed and adaptive rule-based models, normative and positive decision making, discrete signals vs continous signals, perspective.  
*Weaknesses*: Shapley value (got the concept, not the maths)

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Shapley value maths, I handled the overall concept however not the maths. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Focus on the math and revise the material after the lecture.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
In reflecting upon this lecture, it was useful to observe all the different factors that alter a person's perspective which is why it is so difficult to model people.
Discrete signalling; pooling, separating and partial-pooling vs continuous signalling where signals vary in magnitude.
