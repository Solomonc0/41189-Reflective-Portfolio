## Week 1
### What have I learnt this week?
The introductory lecture taught me about the basics of human complex systems as well as an overview of the subject. It also taught me the key attributes of a system and what
makes a system complex or complicated. There was also the concept of emergence which occurs when a component interacts with the larger system. There was also technical systems
and social systems, and the combined result; socio-technical systems.

### This week I learned about:
 - What is a system?
 - Boundaries, characteristics and key attributes of systems
 - What makes a system complex or complicated?
 - Complex systems showing self-organisation and emergence
 - Complex adaptive systems and their characteristics (distributed control, far from equilibrium...)
 - System categories

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I now have a basic knowledge of complex systems and will be ready for whatever this subject throws at me as a result. I was previously unaware that there
were so many components to a system and didn't even know what a complex (unpredictable)/complicated (more predictable and clear) system was. Basically, I learnt what I was
going to study for the next few months.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process during the lecture, I understood the basics behind systems and the fact that they can be complex, complicated, technical, social and
so on. I gained insight into the aspects of each of these systems.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Most of the content, I found that I could understand most of the systems and the boundaries part well.  
*Weaknesses*: Complex adaptive systems, I found some of the points (particularly far from equilibrium) difficult to understand.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I read through the lecture notes afterwards so I could soak it all in and understand it better. I also looked up complex adaptive systems online which helped me understand it
further. I made sure that I understood it and the far-from-equilibrium point as it is an important topic in this subject.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Possibly get a few more pictures on my notes to help me understand the topics better. Read over the lecture notes carefully and make sure I can comprehend everything.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory of complex systems was the most useful to me because it is the basis of this subject and essential into understanding potential outcomes in an environment. In the
future, I will be able to identify a complex system using the content I learnt in this lecture. This includes identifying structure, behaviour, a set of rules, unpredictability
and so on.


## Week 2
### What have I learnt this week?
I learnt how models can help us understand data that could not previously be understood, and the various other reasons behind using models. Other important parts of this
week's learning include bias and how it affects people's models, how to write a model and REDCAPE.

### This week I learned about:
 - Why we use models
 - How bias affects our perception of the world around us and models as a result
 - How to write a model
 - How models help us understand data, strategise and design things
 - Embodiment approach (realism), analogy approach (abstract), alternate reality approach (purposely doesn't capture reality)
 - REDCAPE
 - A bit about Wisdom of the Crowd

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I have a deeper knowledge of the need for models to help people understand the world arround us, and the bias that affects the creation of models.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process during the lecture, I understood the 7 uses of models (REDCAPE) which explains why people use models. I found that this topic gave me
an accurate understanding of models and the reasons they are created in the first place.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Different approaches to models, REDCAPE, why models are used and bias.  
*Weaknesses*: Wisdom of the crowd (more info next lecture), how models help us strategise and design.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Possibly the maths in the wisdom of the crowd section, but apparently I don't need to understand all that. I felt that a lot of content repeated itself so I lost focus quickly.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Focus with no distractions, do the reflection the same day as the class (rather than a week later) so I remember it clearly. That way I will be able to understand the content
to the best of my ability.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
In reflecting upon REDCAPE, it was useful to observe all the different reasons for implementing a model. I learnt there are multiple reasons to implement a model rather than
for the sole use of explaining a difficult concept.


## Week 3
### What have I learnt this week?
I learnt how models are influenced by human behaviour and how there are multiple ways of modelling people (rational/behavioural/rule-based).

### This week I learned about:
 - The multiple models for people (rational/behavioural/rule-based)
 - Rule-based models
 - Decision making
 - Different types of probability (classical, frequency, subjective)
 - Signalling (discrete and continuous)
 - A bit on the Shapley value
 - Perspectives, heuristics and how it alters the model in our head.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I have a deeper knowledge of the way to model people, and the perspectives, heuristics and psychological effects that alter our perception of models.
I enjoyed learning about the nature of humans and the fact that this means that they are difficult to model.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process during the lecture, I understood how models are heavily influenced by a person's opinion of the world and whether they act upon
rational thinking, behavioural or a set of rules. Some signals are costly and others are not but it depends on whether the person is emotionally strong or weak.
Costliness carries meaning.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Multiple models of people, fixed and adaptive rule-based models, normative and positive decision making, discrete signals vs continous signals, perspective.  
*Weaknesses*: Shapley value (got the concept, not the maths)

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Shapley value maths, I handled the overall concept however not the maths. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Focus on the math and revise the material after the lecture.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
In reflecting upon this lecture, it was useful to observe all the different factors that alter a person's perspective which is why it is so difficult to model people.
Discrete signalling; pooling, separating and partial-pooling vs continuous signalling where signals vary in magnitude.


## Week 4
### What have I learnt this week?
I learnt how system dynamics models analyse dynamic systems with feedback and interdependencies. I also learnt about various different models.

### This week I learned about:
 - System Dynamics
 - Casual Loop Diagrams 
 - Interpreting behaviour (structure and behaviour)
 - Network models and logic
 - Informal mental models
 - Agent based models
 - Compartment models
 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I have a deeper knowledge of more ways to model - agent based, the details on informal models, compartment models and network models. I also understand how
agent based models simulate the world in a 1:1 ratio.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process during the lecture, I understood system dynamics and how the structure of a model can be inferred by the behaviour of an individual.
System dynamics can also represent stocks, flows, sources and sinks. ABM helped me gain insight into 1:1 models which are common.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Network models (done before), all the other models, system dynamics.  
*Weaknesses*: Some of the casual loop diagrams; e.g. reinforcing and balancing loop interactions.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I found the information easy to understand on the CLDs but the pictures confused me. I just resorted to looking at the info.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Do this reflection file sooner, maybe the night of the lecture or day after.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
In reflecting upon this lecture, it was useful to understand System Dynamics and how the structure of a model can be inferred from one's behaviour which I found interesting.
I also learnt about how ABMs are used in daily life.


## Week 5
### What have I learnt this week?
I learnt about the aggregation of decisions and behaviour through the use of statistics.

### This week I learned about:
 - Aggregation of data
 - Random variables
 - Went over stuff learnt in statistics like distributions and CLT
 - Long-tailed distributions 
 - Zipf's Law and Power Laws
 
### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I have a deeper understanding of statistics and its relation to models. I also learnt that aggregating data can be useful. There was also the TED talk, where
contributing to a city is a better choice than to contribute to a specific corporation.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process, I understand the various different distributions used to model continuous or discrete variables. I also found the TED talk with 
Geoffrey West particularly interesting - his analogy of biology and how it relates to social constructs and the economy in particular. There was also the part where cities
will have a constant cycle of innovation whereas corporations have the highest innovation at the beginning but eventually wither away as shown by Power Laws.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Statistics components (done before), probability, random variables.  
*Weaknesses*: Applications of long-tailed distributions to the real world and effects.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Zipf's Law was challenging but I carefully read through the lecture notes and understood it with the help of an example.  However, I understood most of the content due to 
having previous knowledge in statistics and mathematics. I had encountered many of the normal distributions in statistics, along with the Empirical rule which states that 
99.7% of data lies within 3 standard deviations, 95% lies within 2 sds, and 68% lies within 1 sd of the mean in a normal probability distribution. I had encountered log curves
in Maths subjects and could understand how it relates to corporations and cities as described in the TED talk.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Search for applications of these models in a business environment.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
In reflecting upon this lecture, it was useful to understand how aggregating data can help us in daily life and enhance our ability to understand topics. However, the TED talk
was the most interesting to me because of Geoff's theory that cities live forever. This is due to a constant cycle of design and innovation as a result of an 
ever-increasing population.


## Week 6
### What have I learnt this week?
This lecture taught me about how complex systems evolve over time, equilibriums in the Markov convergence theorem and various models and Lyapunov functions. Knowledge about
decision making and how making the correct decision can make a big impact on a system. 

### This week I learned about:
 - Markov models and the convergence theorem
 - Random walk models, Markov chain which is a memoryless random walk
 - Implications of random walks and the decision making process
 - Granovetter's riot model, broadcast model, diffusion model, bass model, SIR model
 - Lyapunov functions

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I now understand significantly more models than before. These models include the Markov model which measure how likely it is for something to transition or 
move between states. A random walk model describes a path from a series of random steps on some mathematical space - after N even flips of a coin where heads is +1 and tails is -1, you can expect to reach 0 if N is large. Granovetter's riot model states that everyone has a riot threshold and if the number of rioters exceeds that threshold, the individual will join in - this shows the importance of the entire distribution and not just the mean. A broadcast model captures the spread of ideas and information through media, and often has an r-shaped curve. The diffusion model assumes that when one person gets new technology or a disease, it has some probability of spreading or being adopted by someone they come into contact with. The bass model combines diffusion and broadcast models. The SIR model is similar to the diffusion model but it states that someone may recover from a disease and become infected again. <br>
A Lyapunov function is when f(x) has a max/min and if it changes state, it needs to approach the max/min eventually and go to equilibrium. It is possible to calculate the number of cycles needed for equilibrium. It is path dependent and not a stochastic process unlike a Markov model.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process during the lecture, I gained insight into how the SIR model can be used to explain the virulence of diseases and how effective a vaccine is. Using data online and the lecture notes, I found that R0 for COVID-19 is 3.5 and given this, we can calculate what percentage of the population need to be vaccinated against it to prevent it from spreading. 1-(1/3.5) ≈ 71% and this means that vaccinating 70% will have no effect and COVID will still spread. If 72% are vaccinated, it will cease to spread. I found this quite interesting and it showed how important vaccines can be. The mention of the diffusion and broadcast models also made me think about COVID and how it can spread between people and the broadcast probability on the news.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: All the models and convergence theorems. I have previous knowledge in matrix multiplication and binomial probability so it wasn't too difficult to understand.    
*Weaknesses*: Didn't quite understand the bell curve superimposed with the S-shaped diffusion curve? Application of Lyapunov functions.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I realised that the bell curve reflects the data on the S-shaped curve. I.e. the majority (in the middle of the bell curve) is when most people get the disease or adopt the technology. Towards the end of the S-shaped curve lies the laggards. I learnt about the Lyapunov function and understood how it reaches an equilibrium unlike Zeno's paradox. I had previous knowledge on Zeno's paradox (I did an assignment on it with formal mathematics) so it wasn't too hard.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Maybe some pictures of the SIR model or Lyapunov function, although the Lyapunov function pictures are quite difficult to understand. It will help me in the future when I refer back to these notes.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The Markov convergence theory proved to be the most useful to me because it explained how when a few assumptions hold true, a system will tend towards an equilibrium eventually. If the system has a finite number of states, fixed transition probabilities, have a way of transitioning states and have a somewhat complex cycle (aperiodicity), the system will reach one unique equilibrium. This is useful for a wide range of topics such as science, music and the economy - e.g. GDP changes.


## Week 7
### What have I learnt this week?
This lecture taught me about complexity and emergent behaviour. The lecture went over multiple models that show the spreading of information or ideas from a specific source. 

### This week I learned about:
 - Schelling's segregation model and how micro-motive does not equal macro-behaviour
 - An example about Granovetter's riot model
 - Standing ovation model
 - Axelrod's model
 - Emergence of culture
 - Replicator dynamics
 - Fisher's Theorem

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Upon reflection, I now understand the different models associated with a source spreading information. This includes Schelling's segregation model where depending on the amount of people that are similar to you in your neighbourhood, you decide to move or stay. E.g. there are wealthy areas and poor areas and you tend to stick with whatever reflects your income more. The hat example about Granovetter's riot model helped me to understand the concept more. If person A wears a hat and person B has a threshold of 1, then they join in too and wear the hat. If everyone's threshold is >=1, no-one will take the initiative to wear the hat. The standing ovation model is similar (everyone has a threshold T) but there are multiple factors that influence an individual standing up - the crowd's objective judgement Q and your own subjective filter of the performance E. Signal S=Q+E and if S>T you stand. You also stand if the majority of the crowd stand regardless of your subjective opinion. Axelrod's model is where there is a grid of people with certain feature-trait combinations, and each person looks at their neighbour and may change a trait based on what their neighbour is doing. Emergence of culture is where one culture adapts qualities from another which relates to company culture which is the shared ethos of an organisation. <br>
Replicator dynamics are used in psychology, economics and ecology to model learning and evaluation. Fisher's theorem explains that variation is important to social adaptation of an idea or concept.

### What insights have I gained?
In reflecting upon the learning process during the lecture, I gained insight into how variance can drive and change behaviour in a society. I now know the explanation behind why people of different races, ethnicities and incomes tend to stick together. I did not really understand or know there were so many ways to model a change in a group's behaviour prior to this lesson. In the future, I will now know the reason behind these changes in behaviour.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: All the models, Fisher's theorem and emergence of culture.    
*Weaknesses*: Replicator dynamics.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I struggled with replicator dynamics, so I handled the problem by referring back to the lecture notes and understood the fact that replicator dynamics accounts for both a rational strategy and rule-based strategy. I also noted that there is a weight to the payoff and proportion and that weight=pi(i) * Pr(i).  The picture on the Fisher's theorem slide helped too.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Actually look at the application of the replicator dynamics equation and understand it. That way, I am able to comprehend the maths and how the payoff and proportion affect a decision.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Fisher's Theorem proved to be the most useful which states that the rate of adaptation is proportional to the variation in that population. I.e. we need a lot of variation to adapt to the optimal strategy. This information was useful to me as prior to learning this, I thought that variation was not particularly important when it comes to adaptation and that stability and predictability were more important (six sigma thinking).


## Week 8
### What have I learnt this week?
This lecture taught me more about complexity and emergent behaviour. The lecture explored several models that show how the actions of one and the ramifications on the whole, as well as allocating resources in a range of societal contexts. 

### This week I learned about:
 - Colonel Blotto Game
 - Prisoner's Dilemma
 - Axelrod's Tournament (Prisoner's Dilemma related)
 - Colletive action problems

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
When looking back on this lecture, I now understand these new models that explore how the actions of an individual can affect a group. Colonel Blotto's game highlighted how the allocation of resources can mean a loss or victory for a team or individual and can be used in a variety of sociopolitical contexts including court, war and sports. The winner of the game depends on how many resources are allocated for a particular component. <br>
The Prisoner's Dilemma involves 2 players who can either defect or cooperate. Cooperation from both players is ideal, but if Player A defects and Player B attempts to cooperate, Player A will get a better payoff and vice versa so there is an incentive for them to defect. Both parties defecting is not ideal. This model is applied in arms control, pricing, technological adoption and political campaigns. Tit-for-Tat is the best strategy to combat corporate egotists who may choose to defect, this involves cooperating unless the opponent defects in which case you will defect next round. <br>
Axelrod's PD tournament shows how actors can evolve towards a state of cooperation by using a strategy similar to Tit-for-Tat, but it is more forgiving. If the opponent defects - defect ONCE and then forgive and cooperate again. The opponent will recognise this predictable behaviour however and possibly defect when they know it is the best option for them. <br>
Collective action problems extends the core PD, it is a collaborative effort that takes place in groups and occurs when they diverge from the social norms of a particular situation. The problem is easier to solve when the group is smaller as they can be monitored easier.

### What insights have I gained?
After gathering my thoughts on this lecture, I know more about why coporate entities defect rather than cooperate - for their own financial gain. Tit-for-Tat seemed to be a useful tactic to foster human cooperation but you can never expect when a corporation will be greedy and defect. Colonel Blotto was quite interesting to me as I realised that even though one team may have less resources, they can still prevail as the victor.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Colonel Blotto, Prisoner's Dilemma, Collective Action Problems.    
*Weaknesses*: Nothing.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Didn't struggle too much this week as there wasn't a lot of content. Collective action problems threw me off a little bit but it seemed like common knowledge when I read over it and looked at some relevant examples in today's world.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Maybe I could include some more pictures in the Word document on the Tit-for-Tat topic? That way, it'll be simple to understand when I need to revise the information (I did this after).

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I found all the content in this lecture very interesting and it explained some events in day-to-day life. For the Prisoner's Dilemma - when a shop lowers their price on a particular item, they are defecting against their competitors in order to reap the benefits. Colonel Blotto's game was also intriguing and useful as I can apply it to some games I play that involve strategy and a finite number of resources.

## Group Work and Assignment
### How did we communicate and collaborate with each other?
Our group of 4 (including me) created a Messenger chat that we all used to communicate with each other and give updates on where we were at in the assignment. We organised meetings on MS Teams to distribute the workload between us, informed each other if we cannot attend a meeting and reminded each other of upcoming assignments and due dates. Our group chat was very active compared to other subjects that I am currently doing which was a nice change. Everyone understood when someone could not attend a meeting and replies were very quick for the most part. We all encouraged each other and did our own fair share of work.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
*Strengths*: Communication, encouragement, workload division, we all had a good understanding of the subject.   
*Weaknesses*: Being unavailable, I had morning classes than my group mate had some. Then when he finished work, I started my work - meetings were hard to organise.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Not being available due to work and other commitments. Usually, we were all available during the 3-6pm workshop so we just met up then on MS Teams and it was fine. If we were unavailable during the workshop, we just messaged the chat and organised it there.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Possibly reply to the chat quicker as I was probably the slowest to reply, but I still messaged the chat as soon as I was available, so it wasn't too much of an issue.
